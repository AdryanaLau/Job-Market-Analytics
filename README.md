# Job Market Analytics

## Introduction

The Job Market Analytics project aims to gather valuable insights into active hiring trends in the analytics industry. Thousands of jobs are posted each day on platforms like Seek, yet this data remains largely inaccessible. This project seeks to bridge this gap by scraping job postings from Seek and presenting the data in a tabular format, providing benefits for both job seekers and recruitment agencies.

## Tools Used

- **Python (Beautiful Soup):** Used for web scraping job postings from Seek.
- **Pandas:** Employed for data manipulation and transformation.
- **Power BI:** Utilized for visualization, allowing the transformation of raw data into actionable insights.

## Workflow

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - Utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping Seek job postings.
   - Explored alternatives like Scrapy and Selenium, highlighting their pros and cons.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Leveraged Pandas for data manipulation, extracting relevant information such as job titles, hiring companies, and posting dates.

3. **Visualisation:**
   - Employed Power BI to visualize data, unveiling patterns and trends in job postings.

## Challenges

- Handling dynamic web content and anti-scraping measures implemented by job search platforms.
- Ensuring data accuracy and integrity throughout the scraping and transformation processes.
- Optimizing visualization techniques to effectively communicate insights from the data.

## Repository Structure

- **code:** Contains Python scripts for web scraping and data transformation.
- **data:** Stores sample datasets and data files used in the project.
- **documentation:** Includes project documentation, README files, and any additional resources.
- **visualizations:** Contains visualizations generated using Power BI or other tools.
